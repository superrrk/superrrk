👩🏻‍💻  I’m currently working on quantum optimization alongside Strangeworks & Bp in Houston. I'm a sophomore studying CS at Columbia University with interests in startups and Esport industries.
<br>
🌱  I’m currently learning about optimization, app, web, and game development. However, I am exploring multiple career paths that combine business and software engineering together. Whether it's Vietnamese, Korean, or Python, I love learning new languages (both world and coding ones)... let's talk!
