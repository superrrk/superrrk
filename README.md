👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on quantum optimization alongside Strangeworks & Bp in Houston.  
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning about optimization, app, web, and game development. However, I am exploring multiple career paths that combine business and software engineering together. I love learning new languages, both world and coding ones... let's talk!
